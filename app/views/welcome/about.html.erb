  The text is: We are dedicated to the makers, the creators, the risk-takers.  We wake up in the middle of the night and furiously write down ideas about how to make your online life better.

When we're not hard at work, we're hard at play - we're the loud ones in the bar, and we're always the ones shutting the place down.  Human communication and collaboration is what drives us, and it infuses every feature of gCamp.
